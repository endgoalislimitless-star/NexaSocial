This specification provides a complete blueprint for building Nexa. The AI developer should focus on Phase 1 MVP first, ensuring core performance and privacy foundations are solid before adding advanced features. The key differentiator is the **human-centered AI approach** - technology should enhance human connection, not replace or manipulate it.

**Remember**: The most successful social apps solve real human problems. Every feature should answer "How does this make genuine human connection better?" If it doesn't, reconsider its inclusion.

Ready to start building? Begin with the authentication system and core data models - everything else depends on this foundation.
